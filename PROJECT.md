## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Current Stack (Phase 2)
- **Frontend:** HTML + Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS (dark theme, high contrast)
- **Storage:** Firebase Firestore (cloud database)
- **Sync:** Real-time Firestore listeners
- **Fallback:** localStorage for offline support
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first CSS with breakpoints

### Firebase Configuration
- **Project:** career-chute-b0be0
- **Region:** us-central1
- **Database:** Firestore (test mode)
- **Authentication:** Not yet implemented (using anonymous user IDs)
- **CDN Version:** Firebase JS SDK 10.7.1

### Data Flow
1. User makes change ‚Üí Update local state
2. Call `saveToFirebase()` ‚Üí Write to Firestore
3. Firestore triggers `onSnapshot` listener
4. All connected devices receive update instantly
5. UI re-renders with new data

### Offline Handling
- Changes made offline stored in localStorage
- When connection restored, data syncs to Firestore
- Firestore has built-in offline persistence
- Visual indicator shows connection status

## üìê Design Principles

### User Experience
1. **Flow State First:** Minimize decisions during execution
2. **Clear Completion:** Every task has obvious "done" criteria
3. **Gentle Guidance:** App suggests, never demands
4. **Break Stuck Points:** Randomizer for decision paralysis
5. **Visual Clarity:** Restaurant POS-style full-width cards
6. **Instant Sync:** Changes appear immediately across devices

### Visual Design
- Dark theme (existing color scheme)
- High contrast text
- Large touch targets (mobile-friendly)
- Emojis for personality without clutter
- Progress indicators everywhere
- Color coding: Green (on track), Yellow (attention), Red (urgent)
- Sync status: Blue (syncing), Green (synced), Red (error)

### Mobile Optimization
- iPhone 14 Pro Max (430√ó932 safe area)
- Full-width cards
- Large buttons (minimum 44√ó44 tap targets)
- Bottom navigation for thumb access
- Minimal scrolling in Focus Mode

## üéÆ Focus Mode Behavior

### Entry
1. User clicks task card from Today's Queue
2. Full-screen Focus Mode activates
3. Timer starts automatically
4. Task details fill screen (restaurant POS style)

### During Task
- **Top:** Timer (counting up from saved progress)
- **Center:** Task description and details
- **Bottom:** "‚è∏Ô∏è Pause" and "‚úì Done" buttons (always visible)
- **Exit:** "‚Üê Back" link (top-left)

### Progress Tracking
- Time accumulates across sessions
- Pause saves progress to Firebase
- Resume continues from last saved time
- Completion saves total time to task

### Completion
- Task marked done
- Time recorded
- Weekly counters updated
- Streak incremented
- Synced to all devices instantly

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Completion Tracking
- Daily task completion rate
- Weekly target achievement
- Average time per task type
- Streaks (consecutive days active)
- Total applications submitted
- Total networking contacts made

### Sync Health
- Sync success rate
- Average sync latency
- Offline usage patterns
- Multi-device adoption

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Recent Decisions
1. **Anonymous user IDs first:** Ship sync immediately without requiring accounts
2. **Firestore over Realtime DB:** Better querying, offline support, and scalability
3. **No authentication yet:** Simplify initial rollout, add later
4. **Cascade deletes:** Removing app/contact removes related tasks for data consistency
5. **Test mode Firestore:** Anyone can read/write (need to secure before public launch)

### Decision Log
1. **Multi-stage app pipeline:** Chose detailed tracking over simple binary to give user sense of progress
2. **Random task selector:** Added to help with decision paralysis (user-requested)
3. **localStorage first ‚Üí Firestore:** Ship fast, add sync when ready ‚úÖ
4. **Restaurant POS UI:** Full-width cards for focus and clarity
5. **Three rituals/week + daily:** Balance between structure and flexibility

### User Preferences
- OCD/perfectionism considerations ‚Üí randomizer, clear completion criteria
- Needs structure but not rigidity ‚Üí suggested but not forced
- Visual learner ‚Üí emojis, graphics, progress bars
- iPhone 14 Pro Max ‚Üí optimize for this screen size
- Multi-device user ‚Üí needs cloud sync ‚úÖ

### Future Considerations
- Voice input for quick capture
- Apple Watch complications
- Calendar integration (Google/Apple)
- LinkedIn integration (auto-import jobs)
- AI resume tailoring suggestions
- Interview prep mode
- Collaborative features (accountability partners)
- Public API for third-party integrations

---

## üîí Security Considerations

### Current State (Test Mode)
‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** Firestore is in test mode - anyone can read/write all data
- Acceptable for private use / small user base
- Must secure before public launch

### Next Steps for Security
1. Implement Firebase Authentication
2. Add Firestore security rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
3. Migrate from anonymous IDs to authenticated UIDs
4. Add data validation rules

---

## üìû Support & Maintenance

### Known Limitations (Current)
- No user authentication (device-based IDs only)
- Firestore in test mode (not secure for public use)
- No data backup beyond manual export
- No push notifications/reminders
- Browser-dependent (needs modern browser)

### Browser Requirements
- Modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- JavaScript enabled
- Internet connection for sync
- localStorage available (not private browsing)

### Recommended Browsers
- **Desktop:** Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (latest versions)
- **Mobile:** Safari (iOS), Chrome (Android)
