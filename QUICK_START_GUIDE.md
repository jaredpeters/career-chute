## How to Use It

### 1. **Scan Gmail for Jobs (as usual)**
Click "Scan Gmail" button â†’ system imports jobs

### 2. **Check Confidence Badges**
Look for the colored emoji indicators:
- **ðŸŸ¢ Green** = Trust it, data is accurate
- **ðŸŸ¡ Yellow** = Probably correct, double-check if important
- **ðŸ”´ Red** = Definitely review/edit this field
- **âšª Gray** = Field not found in email

### 3. **Prioritize High-Confidence Jobs**
Focus on jobs with mostly ðŸŸ¢ badges - these have the most accurate data

### 4. **Review Low-Confidence Jobs**
Jobs with ðŸ”´ badges might need manual corrections, but you now know exactly which fields to check!

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: LinkedIn Job Alert (High Confidence)
**Email Subject:** "Senior Product Manager at Meta in Seattle, WA"

**What You'll See:**
- Company: Meta ðŸŸ¢
- Role: Senior Product Manager ðŸŸ¢  
- Location: Seattle, WA ðŸŸ¢
- Overall: ðŸŸ¢

**Why:** Subject line contains structured data, easy to parse accurately.

---

### Example 2: Indeed Job Alert (Medium Confidence)
**Email Subject:** "New Jobs Matching Your Search"
**Body:** "Check out this Software Engineer position at Amazon. Location: Austin, TX. Salary: $90,000/year"

**What You'll See:**
- Company: Amazon ðŸŸ¡
- Role: Software Engineer ðŸŸ¡
- Location: Austin, TX ðŸŸ¡
- Salary: $90,000/year ðŸŸ¡
- Overall: ðŸŸ¡

**Why:** Data extracted from email body using pattern matching - usually correct but not guaranteed.

---

### Example 3: Generic Job Alert (Low Confidence)
**Email Subject:** "You might like these jobs!"
**Body:** Generic HTML with multiple job listings

**What You'll See:**
- Company: Unknown ðŸ”´
- Role: Various Roles ðŸ”´
- Location: ðŸ”´ (or blank)
- Overall: ðŸ”´

**Why:** Email doesn't contain structured data. You'll want to manually edit these.

## Behind the Scenes - Structured Data

### Salary Intelligence
When the system sees: `"$80,000 - $100,000 per year"`

It now extracts:
```javascript
{
  min: 80000,
  max: 100000,
  interval: "yearly",
  currency: "USD"
}
```

**Future benefit:** You could filter by salary range, convert hourly to yearly, etc.

### Location Intelligence
When the system sees: `"San Francisco, CA"`

It now extracts:
```javascript
{
  city: "San Francisco",
  state: "CA",
  country: "USA",
  isRemote: false
}
```

**Future benefit:** You could filter by city, state, or remote-only positions.

## Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Focus on Overall Confidence
The source column shows an overall confidence badge that considers all fields. Use this for quick quality assessment.

### Tip 2: Hover for Details
Hover over any confidence badge to see why it got that rating.

### Tip 3: Pattern Recognition
After a few imports, you'll recognize which email sources give high vs low confidence:
- LinkedIn job alerts â†’ Usually ðŸŸ¢
- Indeed alerts â†’ Usually ðŸŸ¡
- Generic newsletters â†’ Usually ðŸ”´

### Tip 4: Trust High Confidence
Jobs with ðŸŸ¢ badges can be immediately graded/categorized without verification.

### Tip 5: Bulk Review Low Confidence
Use the checkbox system to bulk-review all ðŸ”´ jobs together.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Scan Gmail for new jobs

## Questions?

- **Q: Do I need to re-import old jobs?**
  - A: No! Old jobs work fine. Only new imports get confidence tracking.

- **Q: Can I turn off the badges?**
  - A: They only show on jobs with metadata, so old/manual jobs won't have them.

- **Q: Does this slow down Gmail scanning?**
  - A: No impact - the calculations are instant.

- **Q: What if a high-confidence job is wrong?**
  - A: Still possible but rare. Confidence indicates parsing quality, not email accuracy.
